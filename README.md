I created this website for my college fest promotion.
So that we could engage with the students of other departments.
So that we could tell them about the fest.
I took the power button from the codepen and the backend was done by me along with the quote section of the page. 
This helped me to write better code, and this was my first project that i had done JavaScript.
I figured out everything on that day and deployed it on that day.
